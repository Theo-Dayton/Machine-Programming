COMP40 homework 4: arith
Theo Dayton (tdayto01) and Thomson Brand (tbrand04)

We received some help from TAs, but otherwise we worked on our own. 

Compression appears to work properly, but decompression does not.

The compress40 file contains the implementations for both the compress40 and
the decompress40 functions, which are called based off of the command line
inputs. Compress works by reading in a ppm, and storing its values as a
smaller bitpack which saves size. decompress then is able to retrieve the
values in the bitpack to display the original image


Bitpack uses bitwise logic to extract and manipulate data stored in
packed integers.

It took us about 10 hours to analyze and understand this assignment more fully,
and about 12 to complete the assignment.
