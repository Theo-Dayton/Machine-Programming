Final UM:

The routines that takes up the most time in our final UM is the UArray_at
function which is roughly 33% of the time in our program, while other functions
all take up less than 10%.
The assembly code for this function could be improved by skipping some lines
that are not necessary for the functionality when speed is the most important
thing. For example, there are cmp, test, and je lines that are all meant to
catch user errors, since one of the assembly line in Uarray_at is to callq
Except_Raise. There are also assembly code instructions that are meant to reach
whatever the element in the Uarray is pointing to. If we used a c-array
instead, which stores elements instead of pointers, there would be no need to
access more memory, saving a lot of time.
